## [Some Project Features](https://github.com/programming-hero-web-course-4/b8a10-brandshop-client-side-NafizUddin)

There are some features in this project. Here I have provided some of them:

- Dark/Light Theme Toggle - There is a button in the top right corner which enables the toggle between light and dark mode. This feature is implemented on the whole website.

- Add Items to Database - There is a `Add items` route and in that route, we will get a form to add data in the database. This form contains the information of food items and beverages.

- Add to Cart - There is a button named `Add to Cart` in Food item details page which adds the functionality of adding particular food items to the Cart. If the item is already in the cart, then it shows a error message.

- Update Items to Database - There is a `Update Items` button in each food item card which redirects to a form to update the info of that item.

- My Cart Page - There is a `My Cart` route in this website. A user will find the items which he/she has added to cart. In that page, there is a `Delete` button and if the user want to remove any item from the cart, this button enables this opportunity to delete the item.

- Authentication - There is a `sign in` button in the navbar. By clicking the button, it will lead the users to a sign in form. By putting the registered email and password, they can login and enjoy all features of website. Once they get signed in, their name and photo will be shown in the navbar. The users can also login to website with `Google` or `Github` by clicking the logos and those logos are in the bottom of the Sign in form.

Those who are first visitors to the website, they have to register first to see all the contents of the website. They will find an option to create account in the bottom of login form. By clicking that option, they will go to `Sign Up` page. Once they get signed up, their name and photo will be shown in the navbar.
