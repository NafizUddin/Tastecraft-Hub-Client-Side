## [Some Project Features](https://github.com/programming-hero-web-course2/my-course-roster-NafizUddin)

There are some features in this project. Here I have provided some of them:

- Sign in to the website - There is a `sign in` button in the navbar. In order to sign in to the website, users have to click that button and it will lead to sign in form. By providing their registered email and password, they can sign in to the website and enjoy the all features of website. Once they get signed in, their name and photo will be shown in the navbar.

- Sign in with Google and Github - In the bottom of Sign in form, there are the logos of `Google` and `Github`. Users can sign in by clicking those logos with their registered gmail or github account. Once they get signed in, their name and photo will be shown in the navbar.

- Sign Up to the website - Those who are first visitors to the website, they have to register first to see all the contents of the website. At first, they have to click the `Sign In` button in the navbar and it will lead them to sign in page. Afterwards, they will find an option to create account in the bottom of login form. By clicking that option, they will go to `Sign Up` page. To sign up, they have to fill up the input fields. Once they get signed up, their name and photo will be shown in the navbar.

- Event Packages Details - There is `View Details` button in each event package card in the homepage. Once users clicked that button, it will lead them to that particular event package's details page. In this page, users will get what the company offers to them for that package.

- Feedback Form - There is a `Feedback Form` in the `Contact` route to get feedback of services of the company and also to inquire about any package.
